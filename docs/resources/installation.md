# yba_installation (Resource)

Manages the installation of YugabyteDB Anywhere on an existing virtual machine. This resource does not track the remote state and is only provided as a convenience tool. To reinstall, taint this resource and re-apply. To see remote output, run with TF_LOG=INFO.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "yba" {
  alias = "unauthenticated"
  host  = "<host ip address>"
}

resource "yba_installation" "installation" {
  provider                  = yba.unauthenticated
  public_ip                 = "<public-ip-of-yba-node>"
  private_ip                = "<private-ip-of-yba-node>"
  ssh_host_ip               = "<ip-of-yba-node-for-ssh>"
  ssh_user                  = "<ssh-user>"
  ssh_private_key           = file("<ssh-private-key-filepath>")
  replicated_config_file    = "<path-to-replicated.conf-file>"
  replicated_license_file   = "<path-to-replicated.rli-file>"
  application_settings_file = "<path-to-application_settings.conf-file>"
}
```


On the machine running terraform, ensure the following files are available:

1. [replicated.conf](https://github.com/yugabyte/terraform-provider-yba/blob/main/modules/resources/replicated.conf): For configuration of replicated settings.
1. [application_settings.conf](https://github.com/yugabyte/terraform-provider-yba/blob/main/modules/resources/application_settings.conf): YugabyteDB Anywhere application settings in Replicated console (it is recommended to have http enabled and https disabled for terraform workflow).
1. A [Replicated license file for YugabyteDB Anywhere](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/default/#upload-the-license-file).
