# yba_restore (Resource)

Restoring backups for universe. This resource does not track the remote state and is only provided as a convenience tool. It is recommended to remove this resource after running terraform apply.

~> **Note:** The YugabyteDB Anywhere Terraform provider supports restores in YugabyteDB Anywhere version 2.18.1 and later.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "yba_restore" "restore" {
  // information of backups can be retrieved from yba_backup_info
  universe_uuid       = "<target-universe-uuid>"
  keyspace            = "<keyspace-name>"
  storage_location    = "<storage-location-of-backup>"
  restore_type        = "<table-type>"
  storage_config_uuid = "<storage-config-uuid-of-backup>"
}
```

The details for configuration are available in the [YugabyteDB Anywhere Restore universe data](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/restore-universe-data/ysql/).
