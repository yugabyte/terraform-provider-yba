# yba_installer (Resource)

-> **Note:** Ensure the YugabyteDB Anywhere host has **curl** installed to allow the YBA Installer package downloads during *terraform apply*.

Manages the installation of YugabyteDB Anywhere on an existing virtual machine using YBA Installer.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "yba" {
  alias = "unauthenticated"
  host  = "<host ip address>"
}

resource "yba_installer" "install" {
  provider                  = yba.unauthenticated
  ssh_host_ip               = "<ip-of-yba-node-for-ssh-commands>"
  ssh_user                  = "<ssh-user>"
  ssh_private_key_file_path = "<ssh-private-key-filepath>"
  yba_license_file          = "<path-to-yba-license.lic-file>"
  application_settings_file = "<path-to-application_settings.conf-file>"
  yba_version               = "<YugabyteDB Anywhere-version-with-build-number>"
}
```

To upgrade YugabyteDB Anywhere version, change *yba_version* to the desired version and run *terraform apply*. In case the upgarde fails mid-way, taint the resource in the *terraform.tfstate* file and rerun the *apply* command.

-> **Note:** If modifications are made in the configuration file contents, set *reconfigure* to *true* for the changes to be acknowledged.

-> **Note:** The paths for server certs and keys on the YugabyteDB Anywhere host are **/tmp/server.crt** and **/tmp/server.key** respectively, which need to be set in the configuration file before installation for proper usage.

To change any of the following file contents -

1. License File (yba_license_file)
2. TLS Certificate File (tls_certificate_file)
3. TLS Key File (tls_key_file)

Change the path on the corresponding resource field and run *terraform apply* for the new files to be uploaded.

For further details on configuration and host requirements, refer to [Install YBA software using YBA Installer](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/).
