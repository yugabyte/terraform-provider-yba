    provider                  = yb.unauthenticated
    public_ip                 = "<public-ip-of-yba-node>"
    private_ip                = "<private-ip-of-yba-node>"
    ssh_host_ip               = "<ip-of-yba-node-for-ssh>"
    ssh_user                  = "<ssh-user>"
    ssh_private_key           = file("<ssh-private-key-filepath>")
